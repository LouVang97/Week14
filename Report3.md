	This weekend I focus on iPXE (Preboot eXecution Envireonment), my goal is to install the iPXE into the USB. 
  iPXE is the leading open source network boot firmware. 
  iPXE is a part of netboot that will need to install to provide a user friendly menu from within the BIOS 
  that will easily choose the operating system along with any specific types of versions or bootable flags. 
Here is the website I download iPXE from:
http://ipxe.org/download 
I’m used this website to guide me through:
https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#0 – instead install ubuntu, I stall iPXE
I’m used this website to help me with the USB drives installation:

	After I installed iPXE in the USB, when I got to BIOS the iPXE is still fail. Now I still trying to figure it out. When I did, I’ll post the result.
