Compiled iPXE 

I compiled iPXE on the USB for the compiler on chapter 15. There are many obstaces that I ran to while trying to install this. 
First I went to ipxe's website to install the version of it without reading the instruction. That is the biggest mistake I made.
I went back to the website and read the instruction. The first step I have to do is clone the ipxe's website while using the terminal
and then install the packages in order to build iPXE. However, I still couldn't figure it out. I went to asked Pavel for help, since 
he did the same thing. He told me to go look at his report on this. While looking at his report and try to configured, I still cannot 
do it. Some steps in the report were unclear. During class, I asked for his help. With his helps, I be able configure it. However, I 
got to start everything all over again. Configured this at home by myself. I used Pavel's report to guide me through the process.
With liblzma, I realzed that in the first place I configure it wrong while looked the report. I used pavel's solution for it and it 
work. The second error I did was I forgot to turn the https(port 443) on in ipxe/src/config. The last part of it was the guide the ipxe
to my home directory for me to be able install it on my USB. I went to ipxe/src/bin and copied "ipxe.iso". I drag that to the USB on 
rufus.
