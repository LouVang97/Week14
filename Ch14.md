Change window manager 

I chnaged my window manager to Window Maker. Window Maker is an X11 window manager originally designed to provide integration 
support for the GNUstep Desktop Environment. The reason why I chose this window manager linux becuase I using window as my desktop
instead of liunx. I dowaland the latest version which is 0.95.8, relaesed on 11.03.2017. When the installtion is finished it, I 
click on and it brought me to view download-internet explorer. In the action section,I clicked saved and then open. This brought 
me to the internet explorer page. That's how I changed my window manager.
